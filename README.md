# selenium-testNg-partI

# a new project.
  # in this project I integrated with selenium the TestNg tools.
  # testNg is a framework that allows you to create test cases.
  # in this part, I did a tour that concerns the basics of TestNg: annotations, asserts ...

  # each class reflects on a separate project or demonstration.

  # in another I will use these notions while integrating in an example project.

  # I stored the data in a separate file, by the suits I recovered it and send in the web elements to test

  # to run the examples correctly you have to modify the static urls, ie the location of the files I used.
let's go ;)
